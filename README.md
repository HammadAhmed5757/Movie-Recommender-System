Content-Based Movie Recommender System
This project implements a content-based movie recommender system using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.
The system analyzes movie metadata such as plot summaries, genres, and cast information to generate personalized recommendations based on user preferences.
Leveraging Python libraries like scikit-learn and NLTK, along with data preprocessing techniques and feature engineering, the recommender system autonomously suggests relevant movies to users.
This project provides insights into recommendation systems and showcases their practical application in enhancing user experiences in the entertainment industry
